[![Stonefish ROS 2 Build](https://github.com/vortexntnu/stonefish_ros2/actions/workflows/build-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vortexntnu/stonefish_ros2/actions/workflows/build-package.yml)

### stonefish_ros2 package for ROS

This package delivers a ROS2 interface for the _Stonefish_ library. It also includes a standard simulator node, which loads the simulation scenario from a scenario description file (XML). The included parser extends the standard functionality of the _Stonefish_ library to enable search for files, resolution of parameters as well as a complete message interface. 

### Installation

1. Install the open-source [Stonefish](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish) library (*the same version as the ROS2 package!*).
2. Clone the *stonefish_ros2* package to your workspace.
3. Compile the workspace.

### Launching

To run the standard simulator node you have to include the 'stonefish_simulator.launch.py' file in your own launch file, overriding the default arguments.
Please refer to the documentation for details.

### Support
I offer paid support on setting up the simulation of your own systems, including necessary 3D modelling (simplification of CAD models for physics, preparation of accurate visualisations, etc.), setup of simulation scenarios, development of new sensors, actuators, and custom features that do not require significant changes to the code base. Please contact me at [patryk.cieslak@udg.edu](mailto:patryk.cieslak@udg.edu).
